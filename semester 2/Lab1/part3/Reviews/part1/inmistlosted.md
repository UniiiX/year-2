## Review
#### Use Case:
* Actor has no name?
* Not sure, but probably searching for information doesn't include both searching for contacts and messages. 
If so, it would be better to get rid of either "**Find information**" or "**Search for needed contacts/information**".
* Also, included cases are meant to be required and not optional, hence **Change profile settings** branch is also incorrect.

#### Class:
* What is "UserID"? Maybe "int" was meant to be used? Everything else is fine.

#### Activity:
* So, as far as I understood, every time you text other user you add him to friend list? Is that how it really works??
* Also, are you really supposed to log out and exit the app every time you message someone? IMO, it would be better to put 
final node instead of **Log out** action.

Everything else is quite clear, good looking and most likely correct. Really nice diagrams.
