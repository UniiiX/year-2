Binary Search Tree - rooted binary tree, whose internal nodes each store a key and an associated value and each 
have two distinguished sub-trees, commonly denoted left and right. The tree additionally satisfies the binary
search property, which states that the key in each node must be greater than or equal to any key stored in the left
sub-tree, and less than or equal to any key stored in the right sub-tree.

Splay Tree - self-balancing binary search tree with the additional property that recently accessed elements are quick
to access again. It performs basic operations such as insertion, look-up and removal in O(log n) amortized time. For 
many sequences of non-random operations, splay trees perform better than other search trees, even when the specific 
pattern of the sequence is unknown.

Group - group of students(presumably, in some university).

Student - a person who studies at a university.

Inorder tree walk(inorder tree traversal) - traversal of the tree in the following order: left subtree, root, right subtree.

Print <some> tree - means printing tree of <some> type into console using inorder tree walk.

Predecessor (of some node) - node with the largest key that is smaller than the key of target node.

Successor (of some node) - node with the smallest key that is greater than the key of target node.

Splay - operation that puts the target node into the root by consecutively rotating it left or right.

Merge - operation that merges two splay trees, provided that all keys of one subtree are smaller than all keys of
another one.

Split (by some key) - operation that splits splay tree into two trees so that all keys in one of them are smaller than
the target key and all keys of another one are greater than the target key.
