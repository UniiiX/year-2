Changes that were made to the program in comparison to its initial state:

1. Added unit tests (SplayTreeTests.cpp):
Tested work of insert, remove and search methods with integers with the help of Catch2 framework.

2. Created generaliztion for SplayTree - BinarySearchTree:
  - moved field root of type Node* from the class SplayTree to the protected section of the class BinarySeacrhTree;
  - moved methods minimum, maximum, predecessor, successor, zig, searchUtility, print, search;
  from the class SplayTree to the protected section of the class BinarySeacrhTree;
  from class SplayTree to protected section of class BinarySeacrhTree;
  - renamed method zig to rotate;
  - renamed method searchUtility to search parent;
  - renamed method search to search_;
  - moved struct Node from class SplayTree to protected section of class BinarySeacrhTree;
  - implemented public getter getRoot() for field root of class BinarySearchTree;
  - implemented public virtual methods search, insert, remove and print.
  
3. Inherited class SplayTree form the class BinarySearchTree:
  - fixed a bug in split method(now if the node with desired key wasn't found, pivot becomes its successor or predecessor);
  - methods insert, remove, search now override respective methods of the class BinarySearchTree;
  - call of zig method in splay method was replaced by the corresponding method rotate of class BinarySearchTree;
  - method search now returns read-only object of type Node;
  - Node* toBeInserted was renamed to Node* inserted in insert method;
  - methods insert and search_ of the class BinarySearchTree is now used in respective method of class SplayTree;
  - commented out the line which was responsible for printing message that key was not found in method remove,
  because it was flooding the console;
  - renamed Node* toBeDeleted to Node* toBeRemoved in method remove;
  - replaced all calls to the field root with calls to the respective field of the class BinarySearchTree;
  - replaced call of method searchUtility with call of method search_ of the class BinarySearchTree;
  
4. main.cpp:
  - implemented function testBinarySearchTree() to demonstrate the work of BinarySearchTree class;
  - implemented function printExampleForCatch2UnitTest() to print() the instance of the class SplayTree that
  is used to test the work of insert, remove and search methods of the class SplayTree in SplayTreeTests.cpp;
  - added calls of testBinarySearchTree() and printExampleForCatch2UnitTest() functions into main() function;
  - commented out calls of functions testInt(), testMyData(), testBinarySearchTree(), printExampleForCatch2UnitTest(),
  so that they aren't flooding the output when it is not needed;
  - added two arguments - int argc, char* argv[] to the declaration of function main();
  - main() function now returns Catch::Session().run(argc, argv) in order to run unit tests wirtten with the 
  help of Catch2 framework.
  
5. Changes that were done during the first iteration of writing the program(form zero to what is referred to as 
initial state in the context of this laboratory work) and are significant enough to be mentioned:
  - classical implementation of the Splay Tree(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree) was improved by replacing
  methods Zig, Zig-Zig and Zig-Zag with one single method (zig in the context of initial state, or rotate in the context 
  final state of the program) that rotates the node left or right depending on it being respectively right or left 
  child of its parent;
